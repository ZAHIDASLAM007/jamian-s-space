•	Planning:- In reference with point 5(WBS), we planned the modules of the project ,resources for the project ,estimated cost of the project example-hosting cost, domain cost, SSL cost(security) and the estimated time for the completion of project. We also decided the skills required for the project. Some of the skills are- HTML, CSS, JAVASCRIPT, BOOTSTRAP for front-end and MYSQL, PHP for backend.
•	Execution:- In reference with point 4(SoW), we assigned the task to every member of the team. As a team leader, I was the project manager and controller of the project. Ashar, Zahid and Shoaib assigned for front-end part and Shaba and Nikhil (team leader) assigned for back-end part. In this phase, we developed the modules of the project. For better support and communication, we selected the SPM tool FIGMA that help the team to enhance their skills and try to develop the desired product.
•	Closure:-  In the closing phase of the project,  we started testing of the project for desired result. In this phase we analyzed project performance, team performance and finalized the documentation of the project. Now we are working on facts and some minor changes which may improve the quality of the project and its output.

Team gathered all the requirements, designed system, implemented and deployed it after testing it well.
13.	SPM Tool
(Brief Overview)	After considering a list of SPM tool , we selected FIGMA which is available for free.
Figma is a UI/UX design tool with code-generation, high-fidelity mockup and interactive prototyping capabilities that’s used to design apps, screens and vector illustrations. While it’s primarily a browser-based tool that can be used on any OS, there are desktop versions for Mac and Windows, too. Various team members can make changes to a project live and your designs will always be synced and up-to-date for whoever’s accessing them.

14.	Practical Tips
•	 Provide strong password while registering on the app for better authentication.
•	 Use updated version of Google chrome for better experience.
•	Available at slow internet speed, but for better experience and fast execution need good internet speed..
